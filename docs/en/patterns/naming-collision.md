title: The Model Naming Collision

# The Model Naming Collision

The name “Model” in Kosame is a commonly used name, so if another library also uses the name “Model,” a naming conflict will occur.

## Timing of Occurrence

In the case of a library that also provides its own `Model` class to extend (such as Sequelize), this results in a duplicate identifier error, and you cannot import both under the same name in the same file.
In addition, if there is a method named `model()` in another library, confusion may arise at import time between Kosame’s `Model` and the other library’s `model()`, leading to mistakes in the import path or
making the code harder to read.

## Countermeasures

You can address this issue by adding an alias when you import the module.

```ts
import { Model as KosameModel } from "kosame";
```
